# RESTful Routes (WIP)

This is a simple commenting app created using Express for the framework, and EJS for templating. This is not final, and would add the option to modify and delete comments functionality later.

Hard-coded comments can be accessed through /comments
To create/post a new one, go to /comments/new
Refresh page to see the updated comments list
